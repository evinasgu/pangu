# Pangu

**Pangu** is a generic code generator for every programming language. You provide
initial templates and routes, then pangu generates a service project that
generates the initial skeletons based in the templates provided in the request.

Pangu uses [Selmer](https://github.com/yogthos/Selmer) as template engine, 
[Clojure](https://clojure.org/) as base language 
and [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/) as build automation and dependency
management tool.
